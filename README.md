## About This Project

This portfolio is built using the [DeveloperFolio](https://github.com/saadpasta/developerFolio) template created by Saad Pasta. I chose this template as a foundation and spent time customizing it to reflect my personal brand and showcase my work.

### Why I Used a Template

As a developer, I believe in working smart and building on proven solutions. Using an open-source template allowed me to:
- Focus on showcasing my actual projects and skills
- Learn React best practices from experienced developers
- Understand deployment workflows and troubleshooting
- Spend time on content rather than reinventing the wheel

### My Contributions & Customizations

During development, I:
- ✅ Personalized all content with my education, experience, and projects
- ✅ Fixed image rendering and sizing issues in the education section
- ✅ Implemented and debugged resume download functionality
- ✅ Configured Git workflow and resolved deployment issues
- ✅ Customized styling and visual elements
- ✅ Integrated Google Drive for resume hosting
- ✅ Updated social media links and branding

### Technologies Used

- **Frontend:** React.js, SCSS
- **Animations:** React-Reveal, Lottie
- **Deployment:** Netlify
- **Version Control:** Git & GitHub
- **Other Tools:** Google Drive API (for resume)
